# Digital Explorers Hackathon

## The Problem Statement

Ecosystems around the world are under immense pressure from assorted
human activities. As the world’s population rises, there is an ever increasing
need to feed larger and larger populations, which often comes at an expense of
forested areas. Deforestation leads to a slew of other problems, including
increasing CO2 levels, soil erosion, ecosystem collapse, etc.

Using the latest satellite imaging and GPS technology in tandem with image
recognition algorithms we can detect deforestation at scale in a timely fashion
and create alerts that can be handed over to the appropriate authorities.

## Additional Information

While satellite images on Google Maps/Earth are often a year or two out of date,
we can use these for the purpose of the event. A clearly defined forested area
would be used as a training set, where we can manually flag up forest clearings,
immature forrest, mature forrest, etc. Subequently, the trained model can be
applied to a larger area, where it attempt to classify what‘s on the ground and
identify what potentially could be clear cutting of a mature forrest.

## The expected outputs include:

- Code to retrieve satellite images
from Google Maps (or similar).
- Image processing code.
- Creation of a valid training set.
- A trained model.
- Summary of preliminary results on
the test set.
